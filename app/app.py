        This web application uses a Linear Regression model trained on a dataset of salary information.
        The model considers 'Age', 'Gender', 'Education Level', 'Years of Experience', and 'Job Title' as factors
        to predict an individual's approximate salary.
        \n**Model Training:**
        The model was trained using `scikit-learn` in Python. It employs:
        - `StandardScaler` for numerical features (Age, Years of Experience).
        - `OneHotEncoder` for categorical features (Gender, Education Level, Job Title Grouped).
        - A `LinearRegression` algorithm.
        \n**Data Source:**
        The predictions are based on the patterns learned from the 'Salary Data.csv' dataset.

        1. Adjust the 'Age' and 'Years of Experience' sliders to the desired values.
